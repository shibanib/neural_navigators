# Neural Dynamics Across Brain Regions in Decision-Making and Aging

## Abstract

This study investigates how neural dynamics across different brain regions support decision-making processes and how these dynamics change with age. Using a visual discrimination task in mice, we recorded neural activity from multiple brain regions including motor cortex (MOs), prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia (BG), visual cortex (VIS), and hippocampus (HPC). We applied machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to decode neural activity patterns and predict behavioral responses. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions during decision-making, with significant age-related differences in neural dynamics. Older mice showed altered patterns of functional connectivity and different contributions of brain regions to decision-making compared to younger mice. Interestingly, the LSTM model achieved higher accuracy when decoding neural activity from older mice (62.4%) compared to younger mice (54.7%), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in aging brains. These results provide insights into the neural basis of decision-making and cognitive aging, with implications for understanding age-related cognitive decline in humans.

## Introduction

Decision-making is a complex cognitive process that involves the integration of sensory information, memory, and motivational states to select appropriate actions. This process engages multiple brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and sensory areas, which form functional networks that support adaptive behavior. Understanding how these neural circuits process information and how their dynamics change with age is crucial for developing interventions to maintain cognitive health throughout the lifespan.

Recent advances in neural recording techniques have enabled simultaneous monitoring of neural activity across multiple brain regions, providing unprecedented insights into the distributed nature of neural computations underlying decision-making. However, the complex temporal dynamics of these neural signals and their relationship to behavior remain challenging to interpret using traditional analysis methods.

In this study, we leverage machine learning approaches, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to decode neural activity patterns and predict behavioral responses during a visual discrimination task. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for analyzing neural time series data as they can capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships between neural signals and behavior.

Our research addresses three key questions:
1. How do neural dynamics across different brain regions contribute to decision-making processes?
2. How do these neural dynamics differ between young and old mice?
3. Can machine learning models effectively decode neural activity to predict behavioral responses, and does decoding performance differ with age?

By comparing neural dynamics and decoding performance between young and old mice, we aim to identify age-related changes in functional connectivity and information processing that may underlie cognitive aging. This research has important implications for understanding the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline and developing potential interventions to preserve cognitive function in aging populations.

## Materials and Methods

### Subjects
We used male C57BL/6J mice divided into two age groups: young (3-6 months, n=5) and old (18-24 months, n=5). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with national guidelines for animal research.

### Behavioral Task
Mice were trained on a visual discrimination task where they had to respond to visual stimuli presented on a screen by making a choice (left or right) to receive a water reward. The task included three trial types: left-choice, right-choice, and no-go trials. Performance was measured by success rate and response time.

### Neural Recordings
Neural activity was recorded using Neuropixels probes implanted in multiple brain regions, including:
- Motor cortex (MOs)
- Prefrontal cortex (PFC)
- Basal ganglia (BG)
- Visual cortex (VIS)
- Hippocampus (HPC)

Both spike data (single-unit activity) and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously during task performance.

### Data Preprocessing
Neural data were preprocessed to extract relevant features:
1. Spike data were binned into 10ms intervals and normalized
2. LFP data were filtered into frequency bands (theta, beta, gamma) and power features were extracted
3. Data were aligned to task events (stimulus onset, choice, outcome)
4. Sessions were combined across animals within each age group

### LSTM Model Architecture
We implemented an LSTM-based neural network to decode neural activity and predict behavioral responses:
- Input: Neural activity features from all recorded brain regions
- Architecture: Masking layer, LSTM layer (64 units), batch normalization, dense layers
- Output: Three-class classification (left, right, no-go)
- Training: 80% training, 20% testing split, early stopping, Adam optimizer

### Analysis Approach
1. Trained separate LSTM models for young and old mice
2. Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. Analyzed feature importance to determine the contribution of different brain regions
4. Compared functional connectivity patterns between age groups

## Results

### Neural Dynamics During Decision-Making
Analysis of neural activity revealed distinct patterns across brain regions during different phases of the decision-making process. The motor cortex (MOs) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) showed increased activity during the decision phase, while visual cortex (VIS) activity was prominent during stimulus presentation. Basal ganglia (BG) activity patterns differed between correct and incorrect trials, suggesting a role in performance monitoring and feedback processing.

### Age-Related Differences in Neural Dynamics
Comparison between young and old mice revealed significant differences in neural dynamics:
1. Altered temporal patterns of activity in prefrontal and motor regions
2. Different functional connectivity patterns between brain regions
3. Changes in the relative contribution of brain regions to decision-making

### LSTM Model Performance
The LSTM models successfully decoded neural activity to predict behavioral responses, with performance metrics as follows:

| Age Group | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Young     | 54.68%   | 55.10%    | 54.68% | 52.51%   |
| Old       | 62.42%   | 59.46%    | 62.42% | 60.00%   |

Notably, the model achieved higher accuracy when decoding neural activity from older mice compared to younger mice, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms or more stereotyped neural patterns in aging brains.

### Brain Region Contributions
Feature importance analysis revealed that different brain regions contributed differentially to decision-making in young and old mice:

For young mice, the most important regions were:
1. Motor cortex (MOs) - 46.0% importance
2. Basal ganglia (BG) - 45.0% importance
3. Hippocampus (HPC) - 37.0% importance

For old mice, the pattern shifted:
1. Motor cortex (MOs) - 46.0% importance
2. Hippocampus (HPC) - 38.0% importance
3. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) - 31.0% importance

These differences suggest age-related reorganization of neural circuits supporting decision-making, with potentially greater reliance on prefrontal regions in older mice.

## Discussion

Our findings provide insights into the neural dynamics underlying decision-making and how these dynamics change with age. The successful decoding of behavioral responses from neural activity demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning approaches to understand complex brain-behavior relationships.

### Neural Circuits in Decision-Making
The differential contribution of brain regions to decision-making aligns with current understanding of neural circuits involved in this process. Motor and prefrontal regions play crucial roles in action selection and executive control, while basal ganglia contribute to reinforcement learning and action selection. The visual cortex processes sensory information, and the hippocampus may contribute to context-dependent decision-making.

### Age-Related Changes
The observed differences between young and old mice suggest significant reorganization of neural circuits with age. The higher decoding accuracy in older mice is particularly interesting and may reflect several possibilities:
1. More stereotyped neural patterns in older mice, making their behavior more predictable
2. Compensatory recruitment of additional neural resources to maintain performance
3. Reduced neural variability in aging brains

The shift in regional contributions, particularly the increased importance of prefrontal regions in older mice, suggests potential compensatory mechanisms to maintain cognitive function despite age-related neural changes.

### Implications for Cognitive Aging
These findings have important implications for understanding cognitive aging in humans. The observed neural reorganization may represent adaptive mechanisms that help maintain cognitive function despite age-related neural changes. Understanding these mechanisms could inform interventions to promote healthy cognitive aging.

### Limitations and Future Directions
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results:
1. The sample size was relatively small, limiting statistical power
2. The study focused on male mice only, potentially missing sex-specific effects
3. The behavioral task assessed only one aspect of decision-making

Future research should address these limitations and extend this work by:
1. Including larger and more diverse samples
2. Investigating additional cognitive domains
3. Developing more sophisticated models to capture the full complexity of neural dynamics
4. Exploring interventions that could strengthen functional connectivity in aging brains
5. Translating these findings to human studies of cognitive aging

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that neural dynamics across multiple brain regions support decision-making processes, with significant age-related differences in these dynamics. The successful application of LSTM networks to decode neural activity highlights the potential of machine learning approaches for understanding complex brain-behavior relationships. The higher decoding accuracy in older mice suggests potential compensatory mechanisms in aging brains, providing insights into neural adaptations that may help maintain cognitive function throughout the lifespan. By advancing our understanding of how neural circuits support adaptive decision-making and how these circuits change with age, we can develop more effective strategies for maintaining cognitive health in aging populations.
