# Steinmetz Neural Data Analysis Project

This repository contains analysis of the Steinmetz et al. (2019) dataset, which includes neural recordings from multiple brain regions during a visual decision-making task.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for analysis
- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization
- `results/`: Generated analysis results
- `figures/`: Generated figures and plots
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Planned Analyses
1. Neural Activity Analysis
   - Spike timing patterns
   - Local Field Potential (LFP) analysis
   - Brain region interactions

2. Behavioral Correlations
   - Decision-making analysis
   - Response time correlations
   - Trial outcome predictions

3. Advanced Analyses
   - Cross-regional communication
   - Neural population dynamics
   - Machine learning models for behavior prediction
